The video that helped me the most was definitely the induction video.
I thought I understood induction in class, but when I 
actually tried it, it was a lot more counterintuitive than I thought.  
I think I naturally try to brute force a proof to see if it's 
true or not, but to prove it for every value isn't so obvious.  
The video showed that the only way to do that
is to add n+1 to the general case and work it out to be the same.  
And that without the assumption of the base case, you can't prove anything.
